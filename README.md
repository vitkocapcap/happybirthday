# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Note

This is very simple version (Frontend only) since I did not need to create a server to implement an actual register/sign in process

The Sign In page is fake because I only used simple `if-else` flow control instead of creating a database to store user information. See other projects for more

Anyways, I made this for my girlfriend so I want everything to be her but not anyone else
